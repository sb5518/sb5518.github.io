# [](#header-2)About
I am a Data Scientist with graduate studies at [New York University](http://cds.nyu.edu/) and Fulbright scholar. Prior to that I received my degree in Business Economics from [Universidad Torcuato Di Tella](http://www.utdt.edu/). I have 4+ years of experience working at Tech companies including Vostu and Google Inc.

Some interesting courses I have taken:

- Natural Language Understanding with Deep Learning (with Kyunghyun Cho)

- Inference and Representation (with David Sontag)

- Machine Learning and Computational Statistics (with David Rosenberg)

- Artificial Neural Networks (with Yann LeCun)
